**`Mobile Developer (iOS)`**

I'm a Computer Science student at UT Austin, indie iOS developer and an incoming SWE Intern at ServiceNow. 

I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at UT Austin, an independent iOS developer, and an incoming Software Engineer Intern in the iOS Engineering team at ServiceNow. I enjoy building iOS applications in my free time, and I've published 3 of them on the App Store. I specialize in Swift (UIKit, SwiftUI, Core Data), and I have some experience with Flutter and React Native. Lately, I've been getting more interested in backend development with Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy and MySQL) and hosting with AWS. Lastly, I also have some experience with C/C++ and Java.
